# Pytorch Lightning Population Base Training  
</div>

---
This repository is an extension meant to simplify Population Based Training using [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PytorchLightning/pytorch-lightning).

Currently we are implementing this as a standalone project, but most all of the code is based directly on PyTorch Lightning,
and we hope to integrate this into that package as we develop better testing and integration practices her.
